## 1. System Architecture

The Raspberry Pi is an ARM-based device and therefore needs binaries compiled for this architecture. These binaries are provided by the Arch Linux ARM project which ports Arch Linux to ARM-based devices. They also have a separate community and forum on their website, while original forum does not support ARM specific issues. With the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 2 the packages needed now depend on which architecture the devices has:

* ARMv6 (BCM2835): Raspberry Pi Model A, A+, B, B+, Zero
* ARMv7 (BCM2836): Raspberry Pi 2 (based on Model B+)
* ARMv8 (BCM2837): Raspberry Pi 3

I use Arch Linux ARMv6 Image for Raspberry Pi Model B+ by Linux Mint as main PC

## 2. SD card partition task

* This task will be done with root account, not sudo.

First of all, login with root by

```bash
$ su
```

Input password, insert your SD card, check out device name of SD card and partitions.

```
# fdisk -l
```

<strong><span style="color: red;"># Important #</span></strong> 

You can find what your Linux loads device name of SD card

In my case as see below,

* Device Name: <strong><span style="color: red;">/dev/mmcblk0</span></strong>
* Partition Name: <strong><span style="color: red;">/dev/mmcblk0p1</span></strong>

mmcblk0 is device name, mmcblk0p1 and mmcblk0p2 are paritions name.

Delete all existing parition tables and create new.

Run fdisk with your SD card device name.

```bash
# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
```

Command followings in order.

* Delete all existing partition

```bash
o
```
* List partition

```bash
p
```

* Create new partition (Primary, #1, Size for 100MB, W95 FAT32)

```bash
n
p
1
Enter
+100M
t
c
```

* Create new partition (Primary, #2, Size for all remain)

```bash
n
p
2
Enter
Enter
```

Excute above commands and exit fdisk

```bash
w
```

Screen capture for all above process:

Once you created new partitions, make patitions for usable file system.

Sometimes paritions are mounted automatically, so unmount partitions.

```bash
umount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /dev/mmcblk0p2
```

Make partition #1 as vfat, create boot folder, mount partition into boot folder.

```bash
mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1
```

```bash
mkdir boot
```

```bash
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 boot
```

Make partition #2 as ext4, create root folder, mount partition into root folder.

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2
```

```bash
mkdir root
```

```bash
mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 root
```

## 3. Download image file and install on SD card

Download suitable image file for your Raspberry Pi version, copy to root folder of SD card, move boot file system to partition #1, unmount partition.

Below commands for each Raspberry Pi versions. Choose your own.

Install bsdtar if you don't have yet.

```bash
apt install bsdtar -y
```

* Raspberry Pi 1

```bash
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz
```

```bash
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz -C root
```

```bash
sync
```

```bash
mv root/boot/* boot
```

```bash
umount boot root
```

* Raspberry Pi 2

```bash
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz
```

```bash
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz -C root
```

```bash
sync
```

```bash
mv root/boot/* boot
```

```bash
umount boot root
```

* Raspberry Pi 3

As public website, there isn't specific image for Raspberry Pi 3 yet.

You can use image for Raspberry Pi 2.

Otherwise it's possible to use ARMv8 AArch64 Multi-platform, or ARMv8 Amlogic S905 ODROID-C2 but be cafeful for using unless it is tested properly.

## 4. Boot up Raspberry Pi

Remove SD card from your PC, insert into Raspberry Pi.

Power On.

If you follow above steps correctly, Arch Linux ARM will boot up.

<a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0Bw2KEQNBe4nMZW91OWJNZ2lmX0k/img20160416006.png" data-lightbox="7"><img src="https://googledrive.com/host/0Bw2KEQNBe4nMZW91OWJNZ2lmX0k/img20160416006.png"></a>

By defualt, you cann access Arch Linux ARM via SSH.

> Hostname : alarmpi
>
> Default user account : alarm / alarm
>
> Default root account : root / root

#### Good luck with your Arch Linux ARM !
