Once I installed Debian 8 Jessie it did not have APT repository.

(It might be happened due to no internet connection while installing.)

So, let's add repository manually.

## 1. where is repository list?

It is located in `/etc/apt/source-list`

```
$ sudo ls /etc/apt
```

## 2. Check the available mirror repository

You can check available Debian mirror repository list below link:

[https://www.debian.org/mirror/list](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list){:target="_blank"}

Choose one what you prefer.

## 3. Add mirror repository on list

Using editor to edit source-list (I use nano)

```
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

I addedd at the end of file below repository

```
deb http://ftp.jp.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.jp.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
```

## 4. Save and close. Now ready to use use mirror repository

For example,

```
$ sudo apt list
```

This command will show all available packages from current repository.

That's all! Congraturation!
