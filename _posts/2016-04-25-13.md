`dd` is very convenient but by default we cannot monitor the progress.

Here is the simple way to check dd progress.

Just open **new terminal** and command,

```
$ sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)
```

If you want regular update of dd progress,

```
$ watch -n30 'sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)'
```
By 30 seconds (-nSEC) it will update you dd progress automatically.
